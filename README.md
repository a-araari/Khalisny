Track your debts and record your payments easily, keeping your finances always clear.

## **Personal Debt Tracker Website Project**

### **What You're Building:**
A simple, clean website where you can keep track of all the money you owe to different people and organizations. Think of it as your personal debt management dashboard!

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Django** (backend framework)
- **HTML** (website structure) 
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling and design)
- **jQuery** (interactive features)

### **The Website Should Look and Work Like This:**

**Homepage/Dashboard:**
- Clean, modern design with a big header showing "My Total Debt: $2,450"
- A colorful card layout showing your top debts at a glance
- Quick action buttons like "Add New Debt" and "Record Payment"
- Maybe a simple progress indicator showing how much you've paid off this month

**Main Debt List Page:**
- A neat table or card grid showing all the people/companies you owe money to
- Each entry shows: Name (like "Mom", "Bank of America", "Dr. Smith"), current amount owed, and original amount
- Easy-to-spot "Make Payment" buttons next to each debt
- Color coding - maybe red for high amounts, yellow for medium, green for almost paid off

**Adding New Debts:**
- Simple, user-friendly form where you type who you owe, how much, and what it's for
- Clean input fields with helpful placeholder text
- One-click submit that takes you back to your debt list

**Recording Payments:**
- When you click "Make Payment" on any debt, a popup or new page appears
- You enter how much you just paid
- The website automatically updates your remaining balance
- Shows a nice "Payment Recorded!" confirmation

**Payment History:**
- A page where you can see all your payment activity
- Organized by date with details like "Paid $50 to Mom on March 15th"
- Maybe some basic stats like "You've paid off $800 this month!"

### **The User Experience:**
Someone opens your website and immediately sees how much they owe in total. They can quickly add new debts when they borrow money, and easily record payments when they pay people back. Everything updates automatically so they always know exactly where they stand financially.

The design should feel encouraging rather than stressful - using friendly colors and clear information that helps people stay on top of their debts without feeling overwhelmed.

**End Goal:** A personal finance tool that's so simple and pleasant to use that someone would actually want to open it regularly to track their debts, instead of avoiding the topic entirely!
